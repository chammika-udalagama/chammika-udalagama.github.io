# How to talk to Canvas, programmatically

[Canvas](https://www.canvas.com/) is a popular commercial LMS our university recently migrated to. Canvas offers an API^[API: **A**pplication **P**rogramme **I**nterface] to implement typical LMS activities.

An API is a way to programmatically implement actions (like creating and populating a quiz) instead of using the buttons and text inputs at the GUI. Once set up, this can make time-consuming tasks (e.g., setting up quizzes) extremely fast. So, whatever time you invest in getting familiar with the API will save you countless hours in the future.

In this post, I will share some code I wrote to create and populate MCQ quizzes. The code does not have the Apple-like polish. However, I have laid out the code so anyone new to programming can still use it. 

# The code

- The code lives on the Github repository: [github.com/chammika-udalagama/canva-api](https://github.com/chammika-udalagama/canva-api).<br>If you are new to Github you can just download the repository as a zip file and then unzip, and you are ready to go.
- Requirements:
  - You will need Python installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can use a service like Google's Colab, but be careful about keeping your API-KEY secure (see below).
  <!-- - You will need to install the following Python packages:<br>
    `x` -->

# How to use the code

:::{.panel-tabset}

## Typical Workflow

0. Create an API key to access your Canvas account (You need to do this only once).
1. Create an Excel file with your questions and quiz information using the template provided.
2. Run the Python script.

## API key

### How to generate an API Key

Here is how you can create an API key

1. Log in to Canvas.
2. Click on your profile picture/name and select "Settings."
3. Navigate to "Approved Integrations" in the sidebar.
4. Generate a new API key by providing the necessary details.
5. Copy the generated key.
6. Treat the key as a password and keep it securely. You can regenerate if compromised.

### How to use the key

To use the key, create a new file called `constants.py` with the following content:

```python
API_TOKEN = "COPY_YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Excel file

Please look at the example Excel file (`Canvas-Question-Bank.xlsx`) provided to see how the details of quizzes and questions have been declared. It should be self-explanatory so I won't spend time on the details. However, it is important to note the following:

- `My Quiz Label` should be unique and contain no spaces.
- Use `My Quiz Label` to link the questions to the quizzes.
- You can include the same question in more than one quiz.
- Always place the correct answer as option 'A.'

## Running the code

Once you have prepared your Excel file, you can just run the script in the terminal (or Anaconda prompt) by invoking:

```python
python main.py
```
