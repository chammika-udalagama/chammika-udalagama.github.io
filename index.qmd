# Now that you are here...

Hello! I am a university educator who teaches physics and programming. Welcome to this digital space where my realities of physics, computing, and teaching super-pose.  I am deeply interested in understanding how we, as 'bags of water,' learn and think so that I can be a better mentor and educator. 

This site is inspired by my (wise beyond his years) brother, [Romesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/romesh-udalagama/?originalSubdomain=au)'s suggestion to "work out loud." There are several objectives I like to achieve through this space:

- Clarification and refinement of content and thought one gains from writing things down, 
- A digital space that can be a dynamic repository where I can find my stuff easily! 
- An opportunity to share what I have learned so that someone who accidentally wandered into this site (through the multiverse of the internet) might find it helpful.
