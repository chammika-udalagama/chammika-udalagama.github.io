Welcome to this digital space where my realities of physics, computing, and teaching super-pose. I am deeply interested in understanding how we, as ‘bags of water,’ learn and think so that I can be a better mentor and educator.\nThis site is inspired by my (wise beyond his years) brother, Romesh’s suggestion to “work out loud.” The truth is, I am sorry to say this website is meant more for me than for you. Here are some objectives I would like to achieve through this space.\n\nClarification and refinement of content and thought one gains from writing things down,\nA digital space that can be a dynamic repository where I can find my stuff easily!\nAn opportunity to share what I have learned so that it might be helpful to someone who accidentally wandered into this unregarded site far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the internet."
