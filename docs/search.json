    "text": "Now that you are here…\nHello! I am a university educator who teaches physics and programming. Welcome to this digital space where my realities of physics, computing, and teaching super-pose. I am deeply interested in understanding how we, as ‘bags of water,’ learn and think so that I can be a better mentor and educator.\nThis site is inspired by my (wise beyond his years) brother, Romesh’s suggestion to “work out loud.”. There are several objectives I like to achieve through this space:\n\nClarification and refinement of content and thought one gains from writing things down,\nA digital space that can be a dynamic repository where I can find my stuff easily!\nAn opportunity to share what I have learned so that someone who accidentally wandered into this site through the infinite multiverse of the internet might find it helpful."
